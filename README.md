# üá®üá≥ Chinese Text Analysis API 

Website -> https://chinese-text-analyzer-production.up.railway.app/

This is a personal project to practice programming while improving my Chinese. Hopefully it helps you too.

A hybrid **Go + Python** API that analyzes Chinese text, categorizes words (verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.), and provides **HSK level** classification. The project uses:
- **Go (Gin)** for the primary API
- **Flask (Python)** for text processing with `jieba`
- **HTML + JavaScript** for the frontend

## **Features**
‚úîÔ∏è Categorizes words into **verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions**  
‚úîÔ∏è **HSK level classification** (if the word is in an HSK vocabulary list)  
‚úîÔ∏è **Sorts words by occurrence**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Filters results by HSK level**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Web interface** to analyze text interactively  
‚úîÔ∏è **Go API calls the Python NLP processor**
